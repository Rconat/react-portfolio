# react-portfolio

## Description 

This project is a personal webpage to represent my coding work and projects. This will give me a good foundation to build upon as I further my coding education and begin to add projects and ideas to the site. The page has implimented react components to navigate through pages for quick loading as well as an easy to use user interface. The page is responsive to three different media sizes and is intended to be viewable on full webpage, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Webpage Hosting

The webpage is hosted on [GitHub](https://rconat.github.io/react-portfolio/).

You can find the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rconat/react-portfolio).

## Usage 

This will be continually developed as I learn more coding throughout my studies. I will be able to implement new designs as well as insert my projects as I complete more work. This will be my main github profile which will be easily accessible for future employers to view and get a feel for my work. This will also provide a profile for any other coders who would like to work with me on future github projects.

## Credits

For this assignment I used Bootstrap (http://www.getbootstrap.com) to easily provide the structure of the webpage and quickly iterate out the main elements of the webpage. The main elements I used from bootstrap was the navbar as well as bootstrap grid layout.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
