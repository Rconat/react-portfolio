                                <p>I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp program through Northwestern University. Since I was young I have always been interested in coding and web development and have been honing my computer skills for years. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Design at University of Nebraska - Lincoln through their architecture program. The program has given me a great foundation in the design field which I am continually using to enhance my projects as well as to help myself approach problems with a clear and decisive methodology. I am looking to get a job in web development and I hope pairing my background in design along with my new coding skills will allow me to tackle any problem that may arise in either front end or back end development.</p>
