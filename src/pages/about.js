                                <p>     I am a recent graduate of the Coding Bootcamp program through Northwestern University and Trilogy Education Services. Since I was young I have always been interested in the field of technology and have been honing my computer skills ever Since. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Design at University of Nebraska - Lincoln through their architecture program. The program has given me a great foundation in the design field which I am continually using to enhance my projects. My design degree additionally helps me in approaching problems with a clear and decisive methodology. This was also where I learned to utilize editing software such as the Adobe Creative Suite programs as well as a number of vector and rastor based design tools. Combining these skills with my Certificate in Full Stack Web Development ensures that I understand every aspect of web design and can excel quickly with the knowledge I have gained. I am looking to get my first job in web development and I hope pairing my background in design along with my new coding skills will allow me to tackle any problem that may arise in either front end or back end development.</p>
